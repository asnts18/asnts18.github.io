Starting something new always carries a certain weight - just as how I feel with this first blog post. Similar to writing on the first page of a new notebook, it seems as if whatever you write needs to set the perfect tone, shaping the entirety of the book. But we often forget that we can always tear the paper, or even edit or delete the blog post. Nothing is set in stone. 

Rather than letting perfectionism take the wheel, I'm choosing to embrace this space for what it is: a growing, evolving corner of the web where I can share my thoughts and experiences. Here, you'll find occasional reflections that shape my journey, whether it be professional, academic, or personal.
